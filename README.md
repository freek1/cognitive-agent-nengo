# Cognitive agent in Nengo
Created a cognitive agent in Nengo which walks in an environment and remembers the colors it has seen. It can be asked what colors it has seen and it avoids colors that it has already seen.

## Task description
Use Nengo to create a cognitive agent that can navigate a simple grid world. In particular,
this grid world contains colour-coded locations (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, and Magenta). Your
agent needs to be able to perform the following behaviours:


  1. The agent should explore (even if just randomly) the environment, remembering the
colour of all coloured squares it encounters. It should be able to “answer” a question
about whether it has already seen a certain colour or not.
  2. The agent can be given a sequence of colours that need to be visited in order. The agent
is successful once it has done so. While trying to complete the sequence, the agent is
allowed to visit squares other than the next item in the sequence, but it should avoid
items that have already been visited.

## Report
The report is added to this repository.
